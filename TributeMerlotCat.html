<p>Lolo was found as a kitten in the parking lot of the Working Dog Winery in 2018. 
<br> She was tiny and had a terrible respiratory infection.
<br> With time and care, she's grown into a big strong cat who climbs curtains, howls for treats, and lounges in the sun. 
<br> Lolo is an example of resilience and demonstrates a zest for life. When you're feeling down, think of Lolo.</p>
